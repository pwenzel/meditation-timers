# Silent Meditation 

This project provides a set of silent audio files with chimes at timed intervals.

It aims replace overly-complicated meditation timers and mobile apps that serve the same purpose, but with more nuisance and overhead.


### Usage

Simply copy any of these files to your MP3 player and begin your silent meditation session. 

No longer will you need to watch the clock. A chime will tell you when the time is up.

You can even combine a number of sessions into a playlist to your own custom session.

### Audio Files

Download the files in MP3 format from the [Releases](https://github.com/pwenzel/meditation-timers/releases) page.

|:-------:|:-----------------|
| 3 Minutes  | Single chime played at 3-minute mark |
| 5 Minutes  | Single chime played at 5-minute mark |
| 10 Minutes | Single chime played at 10-minute mark |
| 20 Minutes | Double chime played at 20-minute mark |

## Technical

MP3s are encoded with [LAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAME) using variable bitrate (VBR) to keep file sizes small.

WAVE files are also provided for those that want to build their own.

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) project files and source material are included in this project.
